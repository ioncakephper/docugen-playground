# Contributing to Docugen Playground

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Docugen Playground! It's people like you that make open source such a great community. We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with:

- **Reporting a bug**
- **Discussing the current state of the code**
- **Submitting a fix**
- **Proposing new features**
- **Becoming a maintainer**

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment** by running `npm install`.
3.  **Make your changes**. Add features or fix bugs.
4.  **Ensure the tests pass**. Run `npm test` to make sure everything is still working. (Note: You may need to add a test script to `package.json`).
5.  **Ensure the code lints**. Run `npm run lint` to check for any linting issues.
6.  **Issue that pull request!**

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you're submitting a pull request, please make sure to:

- **Provide a clear title and description** for your changes.
- **Reference any related issues** in your pull request description (e.g., "Closes #123").
- **Keep your pull request focused**. If you want to make multiple changes that are not related, please submit them as separate pull requests.
- **Ensure your code is well-commented**, especially in hard-to-understand areas.

## Coding Standards

This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting.

- Before committing, please run `npm run lint` to catch any issues.
- We recommend setting up your editor to automatically format code on save to adhere to the project's Prettier configuration.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
